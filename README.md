# christmastime
A Python script that tells you how long it is until Christmas day.

Pair this program with your task scheduler of choice and set it for midnight to use it properly
(or set it to run on startup if you turn your computer off before bed like a weirdo);
when you wake up in the morning (feeling like P. Diddy is optional) you can turn on your monitor 
to a wondrous text box telling you how many days are left until the jolly man himself 
gives you your presents and figgy pudding.

If needed, this can be modified to tell you about other holidays (but who cares about those, right?).
