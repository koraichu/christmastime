# christmastime
A Python script that tells you how long it is until Christmas day.

Pair this program with your task scheduler of choice and set it for midnight to use it properly
(or set it to run on startup if you turn your computer off before bed like a weirdo);
when you wake up in the morning (feeling like P. Diddy is optional) you can turn on your monitor 
to a wondrous text box telling you how many days are left until the jolly man himself 
gives you your presents and figgy pudding.

If needed, this can be modified to tell you about other holidays (but who cares about those, right?).


Version A tells you how many days there are to Christmas with the added bonus of telling you that it's Christmas (Eve * (Days until Christmas)).

Version B simply tells you the number of days but with fun block numbers.

Maybe one day there'll be a Version C that does both, 
but for now you're lucky you're even getting Version B 
because I almost forgot it existed until I created the repo (dude).
